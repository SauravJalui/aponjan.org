# Story behind [Aponjan](aponjan.org)

[Aponjan](aponjan.org) is celebrating 14th year Durga Puja, at present (2021). We have been staying far from our [native land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal), missing every bit of traditional celebration, as we have established ourselves in [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai), we intend to maintain this informal contact with all probashi\* Bengalis.

We Bengalis' are known to be scattered almost everywhere around the world. This particular category of Indian people has always made a name for themselves when it comes to wits and its application. However, another thing that can be associated with u s Bengalis' is our celebrations. We are known to be highly celebrative and enjoy our heart out when it comes to a festive occasion.

We are creating an opportunity for the Bengalis' to come closer in this auspicious occasion, this website will provide us a virtual platform to stay in touch with "Bangla Kristi\*\*" throughout the world.
