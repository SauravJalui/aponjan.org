# Story behind [Aponjan](aponjan.org)

We Bengalis' are scattered everywhere around the world. This particular category of Indian people has always made a name for themselves when it comes to wits and its application. Another thing that can be associated with us Bengalis' is our celebrations. We enjoy our heart out when it comes to a festive occasion.

We have established ourselves in [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai) far away from our [native land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal), missing every bit of traditional celebration. We intend to maintain this informal contact with all probashi\* Bengalis.

[We](aponjan.org) are creating this opportunity for the Bengalis' to come closer and for other people interested in bengali culture to learn more about it. [Aponjan.org](aponjan.org) will provide us a virtual platform to stay in touch with "Bangla Kristi\*\*" throughout the world.

[Aponjan](aponjan.org) is celebrating itâ€™s 16th Durga Puja this year. Come join us in our celebrations.
